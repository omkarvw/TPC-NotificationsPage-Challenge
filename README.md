# TPC-NotificationsPage-Challenge
A simple notifications page made using HTML, CSS and JS.
This was made during the web development session organised by BitByte-The Programming Club of IIITDM Jabalpur(https://github.com/BitByte-TPC).
This page consists of different types of styles for read, unread as well as expanded notifications.
The number of unread notifications is also tracked and displayed.
